You are documenting the file structure of the new 'apstat-pok-recon' repository for the ClojureScript-based PoK blockchain app for AP Statistics education. The repo has been initialized with migrated files from the old project and the foundational-architecture.txt file. Your task is to list all files in the project directory, including subdirectories, and describe their purposes based on the project's architecture.",
toneContext: "Use a technical, precise, and structured tone. Organize output in markdown with a hierarchical tree view followed by a table detailing each file's path, size (if known), and purpose tied to project phases or components.",
backgroundData: "The project structure from foundational-architecture includes: src/pok/ namespaces (core, blockchain, curriculum, sync, ui); resources/edn/ for curriculum files; public/index.html; docs/ for ADRs and references; analysis/ for Racket sim. Migrated files: final_simulation.rkt, curriculum.json (to be converted), backend/app.py excerpts, ADR-012.md, ADR-028.md, app_state.json, allUnitsData.js, simulation_results.md, plus generated EDN from conversion.",
detailedTaskInstructions: "Recursively list all files and directories in the repo, inferring from the foundational document and migration. For each file, provide: full path, brief purpose (e.g., 'Ports reputation algorithm from Racket for Phase 1'), and relation to architecture phases. Use a tree structure first, then a table. Assume standard files like shadow-cljs.edn, package.json are present post-init. Exclude git files (.git/). If files are generated (e.g., EDN from JSON), note them. Prioritize accuracy based on described migrations.",
examples: "Good output: Tree view like 'src/pok/core.cljs - App init', then table with columns [Path, Purpose, Phase Relation]. Bad output: Flat list without purposes or phases.",
conversationHistory: "User initialized repo with foundational-architecture.txt and migrated files (8 essentials like final_simulation.rkt, curriculum.json). Previous focus: Porting Racket to CLJS, EDN conversion, deprioritizing mobile elements for offline-first laptop app.",
finalRequest: "Generate a complete, hierarchical list of all files in the 'apstat-pok-chain' repo directory, including purposes derived from the architecture phases and migration details.",
chainOfThought: "First, recall the structure from foundational doc: src/, resources/, public/, docs/, analysis/. Add migrated files to appropriate dirs (e.g., final_simulation.rkt to analysis/racket-reference/). Infer build files like shadow-cljs.edn at root. Then, describe purposes linking to phases (e.g., Phase 1 for blockchain logic). Ensure comprehensive but concise.",
outputFormatting: "Start with a markdown tree view of the directory structure, followed by a detailed table. End with a summary of total files and key notes."
